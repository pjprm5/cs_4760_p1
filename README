README:

I believe I completed nearly all the requirements.
The program can be executed just like you asked:
./proc_fan -n #
The number being 1-20. All appropriate messages for errors should be accounted for.
I think it is cool to do ./proc_fan -n 5 just to see some of the messages I created because it allows more 
time to see alerts of a child being born/killed.
One weird thing I noticed is that the last line in texting.txt fires off twice as two child processes.
This might have to do with my main loop condition.
Everything else should be fine, thanks.
